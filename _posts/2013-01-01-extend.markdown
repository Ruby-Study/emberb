## Compiling ##

Compiling C code to be loaded by Ruby requires some fancy compiler options.
Luckily, Ruby provides a means of easily generating a Makefile containing the
required options called "MakeMakefile". To use it, create the file `extconf.rb`
in the same directory as your C code:

{% highlight ruby %}
{% include ext/extconf.rb %}
{% endhighlight %}

`create_header` creates the file `extconf.h` which you can include in all of
your C files. The contents  of `extconf.h` depend on the preparation functions
you called before it was generated. For example, if your `extconf.rb` has

{% highlight ruby %}
{% include ext/exex.rb %}
{% endhighlight %}

Your `extconf.h` might contain

{% highlight c %}
{% include ext/exh.h %}
{% endhighlight %}

`create_makefile` obviously creates the Makefile, but its argument is especially
important as it defines the entry point of your C code and the name of the
resulting library. The argument essentially defines the name of your extension.

All of the `mkmf` preparation functions and their options are well-documented
[online][mkmf]. I don't think I could do a better job here.
