title: Writing Ruby in C
---

The official Ruby interpreter is written in C. That means that everything you
can do in Ruby, you can also do using function calls to YARV's C API. Why in the
world would you do this? There are two good reasons:

1. You're writing some fancy application in C or C++ and you want some parts of
   your code to leverage the dynamic flexibility of Ruby. You can run the
   Ruby interpreter inside your application and use the API to retrieve the
   results of Ruby code.
2. You're writing some fancy application in Ruby and you want some parts of your
   code to leverage the speed and power of C (or an existing C library). You can
   expose C code to Ruby using the API and compile a special library that Ruby
   can `require`.
