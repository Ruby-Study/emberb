## Running Ruby in C ##

This example is a simple little game of tag. In the game there are two squares:
the blue square is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard while the red
square is controlled by a Ruby script. To make this work, we'll use the C API to
define a little Ruby API that the script can access, and every couple of frames
we'll call a method defined in the Ruby script and pass objects encapsulating
the data for the two squares.

The Ruby script can look something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
{% include examples/ai.rb %}
{% endhighlight %}

The C code uses SDL2 for graphics and input and uses `stat()` (which may not be
very portable) to hot-reload the AI script whenever the file is changed . Here's
`tag.c`:

{% highlight c %}
{% include examples/tag.c %}
{% endhighlight %}

The Makefile is nothing special:

{% highlight make %}
{% include examples/Makefile %}
{% endhighlight %}
