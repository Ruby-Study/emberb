# Why I'm Making This Guide #

Oh my god there are [so][h] [many][g] [freaking][f] [guides][e] [to][d] [Ruby's][c]
[C][b] [API][a]. Why make another one? Mainly because I don't like any of the
other ones.

* Most of them are outdated
* Most fail to cover different approaches when they are available
* Many cover only specific use-cases
* Many have bad recommendations
* Many fail to explain _when_ and _why_ things are needed
* Many seem to be trying for long and boring rather than trying to get the reader up and
  running as quickly as possible

And it struck me that all of these problems come from these guides largely being
on media that do not condone community-driven updates. So I'm writing a new
guide that doesn't suck and is on Github so you too can help make it not suck.
