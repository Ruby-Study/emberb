title: The Definitive Guide to Embedding Ruby
---

<div class="jumbotron">
<p>
The <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruby/ruby/trunk/README.EXT">official documentation</a>
for extending and embedding Ruby is terrible. What little practical guidance
there is is scattered across the Internet and is usually brief, contradictory,
and/or outdated.
</p>
<p>This guide tries to be better. You can submit issues and pull requests on github.</p>
