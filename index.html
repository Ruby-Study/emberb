<div class="jumbotron">
<p>
This site aims to be a complete, practical guide to using Ruby's C API to embed
and extend Ruby. Unlike so many other guides on this topic which are
incomplete, incorrect, or outdated, this one has a github repo!
</p>
<p>
So while it may be no better than those other guides to start with, you can
help make it better! If something isn't working the way I described it, please
submit an issue. If you know a better way of doing something or notice a gap in
my coverage of a topic, please submit a pull request.
